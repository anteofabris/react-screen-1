# React Take Home Project #1

## Projects

#### Project #1 | Restaurant Mini App
   
    Build a restaurant viewing application where users can view random restaurants and learn about them. This application will contain two pages:

    ##### Page 1
    Landing Page where you will load restaurants from [here](https://random-data-api.com/api/restaurant/random_restaurant?size=50) and display in a grid.
    ##### Page 2
    Upon clicking on a restaurant, pass the relevant data through and show a more in-depth look into the business using as many data points provided as possible

#### Project #2 | CSS Show Off
   
    Build a new and custom portfolio/resume website for yourself. Use CSS Animations, Custom JavaScript, and any other cool techniques/skills you know to show off the depth of your knowledge. Push yourself to learn something new in this challenge, but do not copy and paste code from somewhere else. A boring website is better than one copy and pasted from someone else. Additional allowed libraries for this project are:
    - React-Tweenful
    - Data-Driven-Motion
    - D3.js

#### Project #3 | Optional | Fullstack Show Off

    This is an optional project that is more geared toward the full stack. If you have a small-mini project in mind that you think you can build in a few hours or a day, do it. This project should be either 100% frontend, 100% backend, or a combination of the two. 

    Requirements:

    Frontend - React & Styled Components
    Backend - NodeJs & Express or NodeJs & Fastify
      - Typescript is preferred

    Hosting - Please host your project on Heroku, AWS, Vercel, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure

    If you want to participate in this, but are unsure of what to build...here are a few ideas:

    1. A Spotify music player
    2. A What-To-Eat Recommendation Platform using
       1. Yelp API
       2. Location Browser API
       3. Suggestions from Users
    3. Ask a friend!
